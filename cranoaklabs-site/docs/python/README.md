# README.md

Welcome to python labs. The pre-reqs for python labs are Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer (PCEP) skills. See the Python Institutes PCEP site for details:

## Pre-Reqs and Python Labs Description

#### Pre-Reqs

Basic Python skills are the required starting point.  Below are two very good starting points. 

- [Python.org Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) was created by the creators and maintainers of python. The tutorial provides PCEP level skills and in some cases goes deeper.    

- [Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer](https://pythoninstitute.org/pcep) certification provides basic skills needed to start the labs. They offer a free course covering basic skills. 

- Online video training.  Currently we recommend all you can eat [Udemy](https://udemy.com) since they have courses that cover all CranOak lab areas 


## Python Labs

We progressively build on specific python certification areas.  **We do not** complete all of them as some fall out of my core competency areas.   Where Cranoak covers these areas we use one on one consultation specific to a consultants needs.

- [PCEP python basics] these are complementary 
- MKDOCS which is a python based static site generator
- 



## Lab Progression

We follow a simple R1, R2 ... release cycle.  Below is our partial roadmap

### R1
- PCEP cert support
- Cloud labs leveraging PCEP skills

### R2 
- FastAPI leverage PCAP skills
- GitHub actions combined with PCET cert support  *in progress*  
  This will be 

## Python Certification Roadmap and Deeper Learning sites

- The site contains a simplified road map.  A more complete road map is below:

- For you convenience we posted it here.  Keep in mind the roadmap will be update and this map may be stale.  See python institute for up to date information.
